The proofs by calculation of Chapter 1 were all, from a certain point of view, one-step proofs. In this chapter we gradually introduce the ingredients for multi-step proofs. These include establishing “intermediate” facts which get referred back to later, invoking named `lemmas` previously proved by yourself or other people, and taking apart complicated mathematical statements which have been built up from simpler ones using the logical symbols ∨, ∧ and ¬.

  - 보조정리(補助定理, lemma 렘마)는 수학에서 이미 증명된 명제로서 그 자체가 중시되기보다 다른 더 중대한 결과를 증명하는 디딤돌로 사용되는 명제이다
